## The Project

Link to GitHub class wiki page: https://github.com/cs428TAs/w2023/wiki/Aardvark

Aardvark would be a website where a team of software developers can post their bugs/error messages with their solutions. Each team would have their own board of bugs, so that developers on their team can search by error message and find the solution quickly. This will save valuable time for developers. Will feature a way to upvote/downvote solutions to a bug/error. It's called Aardvark because it eats the bugs.
